The findings, based\\n\\\non a study of 60 mice, were published in\\n\\\nDecembers issue of the Archives of Surgery.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nDr. Tonia Young-Fadok, a Mayo Clinic surgeon\\n\\\nparticipating in a U.S. study on whether\\n\\\nlaparoscopic surgery for colon cancer can\\n\\\ncause new tumors, said substances in honey\\n\\\nmight actually help dissolve tumor cells.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nIts not clear what the power of honey is,\\n\\\nbut theres certainly something here thats\\n\\\nof interest, Young-Fadok said.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nLaparoscopies are being used increasingly to\\n\\\ntreat a variety of conditions that formerly\\n\\\nrequired major operations. Skinny instruments\\n\\\nand a slender viewing tube called a\\n\\\nlaparoscope are inserted through tiny\\n\\\nincisions. Carbon dioxide gas is injected\\n\\\ninto the body cavity to cause the abdomen to\\n\\\nswell, creating a work space for surgeons.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nColon tumors are essentially the only type of\\n\\\ncancer for which doctors use laparoscopy.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nSome theorize that the gas might cause cancer\\n\\\ncells to shift location and form tumors.\\n\\\nOthers suggest that inexperienced surgeons\\n\\\nmight inadvertently cause malignant cells to\\n\\\nimplant as they extract the tumor.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nYoung-Fadok said some research has found that\\n\\\ntumors occur in less than 1 percent of cases\\n\\\nand that when the laparoscopy is done by\\n\\\nexperienced surgeons, the risk is essentially\\n\\\nzero.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nIn the Turkish study, led by Dr. Ismail\\n\\\nHamzaoglu of Istanbul University, researchers\\n\\\ninjected the mice with air, made neck\\n\\\nincisions and injected the animals with tumor\\n\\\ncells. The researchers spread honey inside\\n\\\nthe incisions in one group of mice before and\\n\\\nafter the injections.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nAll 30 mice without honey developed tumors,\\n\\\ncompared with only eight of the 30\\n\\\nhoney-treated mice.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nIn a commentary accompanying the study,\\n\\\nChicago plastic surgeon Dr. Thomas Mustoe\\n\\\nnoted that other research has suggested honey\\n\\\nhas anti-bacterial properties and may be an\\n\\\neffective treatment for burns.\\n\\\n\\n\\\nThe study highlights another potential\\n\\\nuse, Mustoe said.\\n\\\nabde\\\n |{ b |{c|<here> d|e}| f}| g | h\"",
