structure of files:

    nodes:
        id: Name of compound
        formula: Formula, if given
        description: Description, if given
    links:
        nodes: Reagent ids
        directed: false if reversible, true otherwise
        reaction_id: Code corresponding to the reaction between these reagents
        reaction_name: Reaction name
        reversible: If the raeaction is reversible
        subsystem: Subsystem the reaction belongs to (usually matches file name)

NOTE: these graphs are subgraphs of a much larger metabolic pathways graph corresponding to different subsystems. They can be combined into the full pathways network.
